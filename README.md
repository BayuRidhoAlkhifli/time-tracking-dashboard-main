## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

For the first time I'm trying to explore using Tailwind CSS framework for styling in my project. The lesson I took from this project is that Tailwind CSS is easier to style without needing to change styles in CSS files or write inline styles in coding.

### Continued development

This was a simple dashboard project from Front-End Mentor, so I think it's just for some practice and to have some fun. So, I'll leave it with no further changes.

### Useful resources

- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - This website helped me to install React JS library and helped me when I forgot how to use API HOOK in React JS.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - This website helped me understand Tailwind CSS.
